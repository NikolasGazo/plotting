## Impetus
I wanted to have the ability to read in a data file (currently only csv) and do some preprocessing of the data.
convert it into a pandas dataframe
Then do some plotting, with the intention of adding specialized plot functions

## How to use
```
 $ git clone https://github.com/NikolasGazo/plotting.git
 Cloning into 'plotting'...
 remote: Enumerating objects: 36, done.
 remote: Counting objects: 100% (36/36), done.
 remote: Compressing objects: 100% (30/30), done.
 remote: Total 36 (delta 18), reused 18 (delta 6), pack-reused 0
 Unpacking objects: 100% (36/36), 137.40 KiB | 1019.00 KiB/s, done.
 $ cd plotting/
 $ python main.py
```
## A window should pop up now...

### read in the default csv file (AEM.TO.csv) and click "Process File"
#### a couple text boxes will pop up with info of the DataFrame types and also a snippet (head and tail) of the file imported

### click "Plotting" tab and then "Import DF" and "Plot DF" with the two buttons

### Now, you can plot!
