## Impetus
I wanted to have the ability to read in a data file (currently only csv) and do some preprocessing of the data.
convert it into a pandas dataframe
Then do some plotting, with the intention of adding specialized plot functions

## How to use
```
 $ git clone https://github.com/NikolasGazo/plotting.git
